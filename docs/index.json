	"content": " Reading notes A repo for reading notes since late 2019. I have attempted it various ways in the past digitalizing the notes-taking process but they all failed. Keeping typed and organized notes does require preservance and patience. Hopefully a mechanism like this can help making it fun and easy, and eventually work out!\nContents in this repo is intended for my self-consumption and book-keeping. It is by no means polished or even correct yet I\u0026rsquo;m not ashamed of not keeping it my way.\nTo compile and publish as a website, run ./release.sos in command shell, and push changes to github.\n"
