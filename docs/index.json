	"content": " Reading notes A repo for reading notes since late 2019.\nI have attempted various ways in the past digitalizing notes-taking process in reading but they never worked out. Keeping typed and organized notes requires preservance and patience that I don\u0026rsquo;t have \u0026hellip; Hopefully a mechanism like this can help making it fun and easy, and eventually solve my problem!\nContents in this repo is intended for my self-consumption and book-keeping. It is by no means polished or even correct yet I\u0026rsquo;m not ashamed of keeping it my way as is.\nTo compile and publish as a website, run ./release.sos in command shell, and push changes to github.\n"
