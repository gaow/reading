### Background

Networks methods:
- differential expression
- differential variation
- abundance
- network connectivity
- differential connectivity

Network connectivity built from significant pair-wise correlations focusing on hub genes but overlook many other widespread pairwise signals. Hence for every gene the authors investigate distribution of all pair-wise correlations cross genome, looking at shapes of such correlation distribution.

  - Assign data to one of 8 template distributions by computing distance to distribution.
  - Use hypergeometric test to determine enrichment or depletion in a shape.

## Result

Look at it in human, animal and fly data. Figure 2 is interesting -- indeed the shapes look very different.

## Comment

Still need to wrap my head around the "distribution template" idea (I wonder why not simply compare one gene's distribution with all genes pooled).
