# Reading notes

A repo for reading notes since late 2019.

I have attempted various ways in the past digitalizing notes-taking process in reading but they never worked out.
Keeping typed and organized notes requires preservance and patience that I don't have ...
Hopefully a mechanism like this can help making it fun and easy, and eventually solve my problem!

Contents in this repo is intended for my self-consumption and book-keeping.
It is by no means polished or even correct yet I'm not ashamed of keeping it my way as is.

To compile and publish as a website, run `./release.sos` in command shell, and push changes to github.
