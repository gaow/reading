# Reading notes

A repo for reading notes since late 2019.
I have attempted it various ways in the past digitalizing the notes-taking process but they all failed.
Keeping typed and organized notes does require preservance and patience.
Hopefully a mechanism like this can help making it fun and easy, and eventually work out!

Contents in this repo is intended for my self-consumption and book-keeping.
It is by no means polished or even correct yet I'm not ashamed of not keeping it my way.

To compile and publish as a website, run:

```
./release.sos
```

and push to github.
